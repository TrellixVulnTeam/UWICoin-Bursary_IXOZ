## Project scope

The goal of this project is to create a form of cryptocurrency(UWICoin), based on the <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled">Ripple API</a> for use on the St. Augustine Campus of the UWI to provide students an alternative to physical cash. UWICoin is trying to resolve the issue of robberies which has become a main concern at the start of the semester. This is done by providing a cashless form of currency to use around campus. As well as trying to create a feasible form of the cryptocurrency so that it can have positive benefits to the University.

The <a href="https://github.com/UWICoin/UWICoin-Bursary">UWICoin bursary application</a>, created using Angular 5, will be used by all bursary staff to add vendor accounts, manage and add bursary general and admin accounts and to accept debit and credit transactions from students or staff.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.
